# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: 
  productionType: "example"
  created_at: <%= Time.zone.now %>
# column: value
#
two: 
  productionType: "2nd example"
  created_at: <%= Time.zone.now %>
#  column: value
